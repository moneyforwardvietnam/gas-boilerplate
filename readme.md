# gas-boilerplate

> Opinionated boilerplate to kickstart creating a google apps scripts

This is what I use for my own modules.


## Getting started

In your directory, run:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/moneyforwardvietnam/gas-boilerplate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=2 gas-boilerplate-master/boilerplate
```

Alternatively you can `git clone` or [download](https://github.com/moneyforwardvietnam/gas-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) this repo and get contents of the `boilerplate` folder.

There's also a Yeoman generator (WIP).
